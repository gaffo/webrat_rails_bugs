=== Welcome to webrat rails bugs app

Basically in here will be a branch for each lighthouse bug that has been verified. The branch
will be named lh_### where ### is the ticket number of the Lighthouse bug report. 

To make a new one, just make a branch off of master (master is kept up to date with a simple baseline of webrat).

For example for ticket 31, do a:

git checkout -b lh_31 master

=== Starting from scratch

git clone git://github.com/gaffo/webrat_rails_bugs.git
git checkout -b lh_31 master
